Q2/- Explain about IOC and Dependency Injection.
ans:
1.In general, when a class depends on another class then the dependent class creates the object of its
dependency class directly, and then uses(call) its methods, it is called the dependency object created in the
main control.
2.But if some external entity is taking care of creating the dependency object then we say that control is inverted
to some external entity, this is called Inversion of Control (IOC).
3.The IOC is a design principle that is purely conceptual, in which an external entity provides the dependencies to the application components instead of hard coding them in the component class.

second part:

Here external entity will push the dependency object to the dependent class (configuring the object inside some
container. and the container will push the dependency object to the dependent class).

Note: In the spring framework, The spring container is the external entity that will push the dependency object to
the dependent class.
