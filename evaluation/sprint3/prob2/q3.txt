2.Spring container loads the spring bean class into the memory and create the bean obj.
3.If inside the spring bean class any user defined init methd is configured, spring container will call that method.
4.Here spring container provides the bean object ref to the caller, then caller can call its business method on the bean object.
5.On the container shutdown spring container will call user -defined destroy() method if it is configured , just before bean instanciate the garbage collectionn.
