Q4/- What is auto wiring in Spring, how many types of Auto wiring are there in spring,
explain with an example.

Ans:

The process of creating association between/among application components is known as "wiring".
We have 2 kind of wiring in spring application:
1. Explicit wiring
2. Auto-wiring (implicit wiring)

If a spring developer specifies the associations for the dependency bean by <property> tag or <constructorarg> tag, it is known as explicit wiring.

Whereas if spring container on its own detects the dependencies implicitly and injecting them into the
dependent bean is known as "auto-wiring".

These are the four type of attribute we define to do different types of auto wiring.
1. no (default)
2. byName
3. byType
4. constructor
 In bean auto-wiring, spring container automatically injects a bean dependencies by either calling a setter
method or calling parameterized constructor without writing explicitly inside the
spring configuration file.
