Q3/- What is the difference between setter injection and constructor injection?
Ans:
constructor                                                            setter
1.It may cause circular dependency         It resolve the circular dependency
2.If the dependency is mandatory             If the dependency is optional
3.If the dependency is "final" variable     We can not inject the final variable through the setter
 then it must be injected through the
constructor injection only.
